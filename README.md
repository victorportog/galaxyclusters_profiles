# galaxyclusters_profiles

Here you can find two jupyter notebook scripts:

- profiles.ipynb was developed during a year for the scientific initiation program 2019/2020 of the University of Brasília (UnB). It composes the work "Perfis de densidade de matéria de aglomerados de galáxias" (translation: Galaxy Cluster Matter Density Profiles).

- profiles_monography.ipynb is a modified version of profiles.ipynb with a few more features. It is a part of my undergraduate course final monography titled "Lenteamento Gravitacional Fraco e Perfis de Densidade de Matéria de Aglomerados de Galáxias" (translation: Galaxy Cluster Weak Gravitational Lensing and Matter Density Profiles).
